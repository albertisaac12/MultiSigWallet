# MultiSigWallet

## Introduction
This Solidity contract implements a multi-signature wallet on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows multiple owners to collectively manage and control funds through a secure approval process. The contract is designed to be flexible, allowing owners to dynamically add or remove signers.

## Features
- Multi-signature functionality: Transactions require approval from a predefined number of signers.
- Dynamic signer management: Owners can add or revoke signer status for increased flexibility.
- Ether deposits: The contract allows for Ether deposits.
- Events: Events are emitted for key actions, providing transparency.
